Create a Student class that has the same fields and methods as the Person class, and has the following additional

    fields:
        previousOrganization: the name of the studentâ€™s previous company / school
        skippedDays: the number of days skipped from the course
    methods:
        getGoal(): prints out 'My goal is: Be a junior software developer.'
        introduce(): 'Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender from previousOrganization who skipped skippedDays days from the course already.'
        skipDays(numberOfDays): increases skippedDays by numberOfDays

The Student class has the following constructors:

    Student(name, age, gender, previousOrganization): beside the given parameters, it sets skippedDays to 0
    Student(): sets name to Jane Doe, age to 30, gender to female, previousOrganization to The School of Life, skippedDays to 0
